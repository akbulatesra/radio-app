With this project you can search radio stations by countries, tags and languages.

Technologies I used;

- Next.js for creating website
- Sass for styling
- radio-browser-api for fetching radio stations
- react-spinners for loading component
- react-toastify instead of regular alert
- react-select for select component

Also I added extra text to svg image for user experience
